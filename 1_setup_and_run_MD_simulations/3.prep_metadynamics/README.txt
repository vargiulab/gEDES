The calc_walls.sh script calculates the linear decrease in the radius of gyration(binding_site) from $initial_value till $final_value for the steps corresponding to 50ns-450ns (stepsize of 2fs) in gromacs gEDES simulations.
meta.mdp is a sample files used to run gEDES metadynamics simulation using gromacs, and plumed files are also provided.
